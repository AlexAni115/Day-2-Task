Difference between Document Object and Window object:-

Document and Windows objects both look similar but have entirely different purposes.

Document object :-
It is called as the DOM(Document object model)
It is the entry point to the content of webpage and allows access to various elements within the Document
It is an interface that represents a document as a structured group of nodes and objects.
It allows the program to access and modify the content, style and structure of the document dynamically

Features;
1. Access to Elements: It allows developers to access the elements and retrieve specific elements from HTML structure.
2. Manipulation of content: DOM allows developers to  create, modify and remove elements and content within the document.
3. Event handling: It facilitates the execution of specific functions in response to user action or system events by attaching the event listeners to various elements.

Window Object :-
It represents the current browser or tab that displays the documents
Document object will be within the window object like a container

Features:
1. Global Scope: All global JAVASCRIPT objects, variables and functions are part of the window object.
2. Browser interaction: WIndows Object allows interaction within the browser.
3. Timers and Intervals: It allows execution of functions at specific intervals or after some delay
